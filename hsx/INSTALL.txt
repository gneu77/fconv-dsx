 You can find precompiled 32bit and 64bit executables for linux in the bin folder.
 Use the following instructions to compile from source:


 I am currently (read 2012) using gcc 4.5.x on Ubuntu and
 gcc 4.5.x on Windows7 (MinGW) and Mac. 
 The code compiles without any errors or warnings with options
 '-pedantic -Wall -O2' on all 3 systems.
 (project setup was done using NetBeans IDE).

Installation notes:
===================

 -> Compilation relies on the src folder being relative to ../../C_libs.

 -> WARNING: The single-threaded version seems to be broken at the moment (does not compile).
             Hence, only the multithreaded version (Release_MT) is woring for now.
             Proper makefile for Windows and Mac are also currently not available.
 
 -> Follow instructions for your target system:
    --> Linux/Unix systems:
        0.) Make sure the following packages are installed on your system:
            - g++
            - build-essential
            - gcc-multilib
            - g++-multilib
        1.) Open a shell an go into the src directory
        2.) The makefile is setup to generate 64Bit code and link statically.
            If you want to generate 32Bit code or if you do not want
            to link statically, you have to edit 'nbproject/Makefile-Release.mk'
            and change the corresponding flags from 'CCFLAGS' and 'CXXFLAGS'.
        3.) To make the fconv executable use the following command inside the src folder:
            'make CONF=Release_MT build'
        => Now you should have 'dist/Release/GNU-Linux-x86/hotspotsx_mt' as
           single independent executable.
        4.) If you have to clean your worktree use:
            'make CONF=Release_MT clean'
