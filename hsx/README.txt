Installation notes:
===================

 -> Find precompiled HSX executables for Linux 32Bit and 64Bit in the bin folder.
 -> PDB potentials to be used are located in the ../dsx/pdb_pot_0511 folder
 -> Execute the program with option '-h' to get detailed and hopefully
     self-explaining usage information.
 -> Explanation is available from https://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/diss/z2012/0161/pdf/dgn.pdf.
 -> If you like to use the CSD-based potentials, you need permission from the
    Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) (in essence, you need a valid CSD license).
 -> An example maps file for hotspotsX is available as: ACC_DON_AnD_HYD_ARO_map.def

 -> To compile from source, instructions for Linux, Windows and MacOS can be found in INSTALL.txt
