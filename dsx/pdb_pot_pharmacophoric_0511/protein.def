This is an atom type definitions file from 'molecule_GN.cpp'

<COMMENT>
--> Everything in the COMMENT sections will NOT be read by the program (it's just comments).
--> In the HEADER section the 'internal_set_type' and the 'total' value is mandatory
    and should NEVER be changed by the user!
--> The FLAGS section and the DEF section are the places where you can make your changes.
--> Each line of the DEF sections that starts with a '*' is one definition. The string following the '*'
    is the internal atom type. The next string seperated by a whitespace (or more) represents
    the type the internal type will be set to for your purpose. The rest of the line will
    be ignored (so you can make additional comments).

--> A short explanation of the flags from the FLAGS section:
    (Changes in the following explanations have no effect. Make your changes in the FLAGS section!)
---------------------------------------------------
Please use '0' for false and '1' for true. If you do not want to override values given
in a function call to MOLECULE::get_atom_typing, please use '-1'

protonate_acids 0     = acids with unknown protonation state will be typed charged
                        (if they are protonated in the input molecule, they keep uncharged)
protonate_guanidin 1  = guanidino groups will be typed protonated (charged)
protonate_amidin 1    = amidino groups will be protonated (charged)
protonate_amine -1    = protonation state for amines is used as given by the
                        funtion call to get_atom_typing (e.g. if you specified
                        protonation states in fconv using '--p' the specified
                        value for amines will be used (while 0 or 1 would
                        override your fconv settings).protonate_phosphate 0 = HxPOy will be typed charged
protonate_sulfate 0   = HxSOy and SO2NH will be typed charged
set_bonds 1           = bond types will be assigned
max_ring_members 10   = A ring with more than this number of members will not be considered a ring

--> A short explanation of the internal atom types: 
---------------------------------------------------
--> All elements having no type listed in the DEF section will be typed by the element name.
--> The order of atom types also represents the priority if there is more than one
    type possible (e.g. a guanidino N that is also bonded to a carbonyl group will be
    set to a N.am type, because this type has a higher priority than N.gu types).
--> Heteroaromatics with unknown protonation state will be typed in their neutral form.
--> Enoles without explicitly set hydrogens will be typed as ketones.
--> Currently there are: (here comes just the explanation, NOT the definition)
