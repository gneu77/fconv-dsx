Installation notes:
===================

 -> Find precompiled DSX executables for Linux 32Bit and 64Bit in the bin folder.
 -> PDB-derived pair- and SR-potentials are located in the pdb_pot_0511 folder.
        (as derived in May 2011, matching the PDB-potentials from the
         publication: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21863864/)
 -> Execute the program with option '-h' to get detailed and hopefully
     self-explaining usage information.
 -> Explanation of the applied potentials are available from https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21863864/
    or more detailed from https://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/diss/z2012/0161/pdf/dgn.pdf.
 -> If you like to use the CSD-based pair-, torsion- and SR-potentials, you need permission from the
    Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) (in essence, you need a valid CSD license).

 -> To compile from source, instructions for Linux, Windows and MacOS can be found in INSTALL.txt
