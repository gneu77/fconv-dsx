 You can find precompiled 32bit and 64bit executables for linux in the bin folder.
 Use the following instructions to compile from source:


 I am currently (read 2012) using gcc 4.5.x on Ubuntu and
 gcc 4.5.x on Windows7 (MinGW) and Mac. 
 The code compiles without any errors or warnings with options
 '-pedantic -Wall -O2' on all 3 systems.
 (project setup was done using NetBeans IDE).

Installation notes:
===================

 -> Compilation relies on the src folder being relative to ../../C_libs.
 
 -> Follow instructions for your target system:
    --> Linux/Unix systems:
        0.) Make sure the following packages are installed on your system:
            - g++
            - build-essential
            - gcc-multilib
            - g++-multilib
        1.) Open a shell an go into the src directory
        2.) The makefile is setup to generate 64Bit code and link statically.
            If you want to generate 32Bit code or if you do not want
            to link statically, you have to edit 'nbproject/Makefile-Release.mk'
            and change the corresponding flags from 'CCFLAGS' and 'CXXFLAGS'.
        3.) To make the fconv executable use the following command inside the src folder:
            'make CONF=Release build'
        => Now you should have 'dist/Release/GNU-Linux-x86/fconv' as
           single independent executable.
        4.) If you have to clean your worktree use:
            'make CONF=Release clean'
    
    --> Mac OS systems:
        I only tested on Intel-based Macs.
        1.) open a shell an go into the src directory
        2.) The makefile is setup to generate 32Bit code.
            If you want to generate 64Bit code you have to edit
            'nbproject/Makefile-Release_macOS.mk' and remove the
            corresponding flag from 'CCFLAGS' and 'CXXFLAGS'.
        3.) To make the fconv executable use the following command:
            'make CONF=Release_macOS build'
        => Now you should have 'dist/Release_macOS/GNU-Linux-x86/fconv' as
           single independent executable.
        4.) If you have to clean your worktree use:
            'make CONF=Release_macOS clean'
    
    --> Windows systems:
        Here I am using a quick and dirty hand-made makefile, as the
        NetBeans makefile do not work with my MinGW make.
        1.) Make sure to have a proper installation of MinGW (including
            make), open a shell and go to the directory src
        2.) The makefile is setup to generate 32Bit code. If you want to
            generate 64Bit code (and have installed 64Bit MinGW), please
            edit 'windows_makefile' and remove the '-m32' flag from the
            'comp' variable.
        3.) Use the following command:
            'make -f windows_makefile fconv.exe'
        => Now you should have 'fconv.exe' as single independent executable.
        4.) If you want to clean your object files use:
            'make -f windows_makefile clean'
